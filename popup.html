              <h3>Why use ShackWise?</h3>

            </div>
            <p>
              ShackWise is here to make your home-buying journey smoother and more efficient. When you're juggling
              multiple options—whether browsing online or visiting homes in person—it’s easy to feel overwhelmed by all
              the different features, amenities, and factors each home has to offer.
               
              That’s where ShackWise comes in. By helping you weigh your personal priorities and rate the
              characteristics
              of each home, ShackWise creates a personalized score for every option. This makes it much simpler to see
              which homes stand out as the best fit for you.
               
              If you're buying with a partner, ShackWise also lets you see how your preferences align or differ. And
              whether you’re buying solo or with someone else, your agent will be able to view your preferences too,
              allowing them to help you secure your dream home faster and more effectively.
            </p>
            <b>Using Notes</b>
            <p>
              In addition to providing your ratings, we highly recommend taking advantage of the notes feature for each
              characteristic. These notes are incredibly helpful for your agent to fully understand your needs and the
              reasons behind your ratings.
               
              If you’re buying with a partner, adding notes becomes even more important. It allows you both to see where
              your priorities align and where they may differ, offering a clearer picture of each other's preferences.
              This way, you can openly discuss any differences and work through them together, ensuring you’re both on
              the
              same page throughout the process.
               
              For example, two partners might both assign the same importance to the kitchen, suggesting they are
              aligned.
              But by adding notes, you may find that one partner prioritizes upgraded appliances, while the other values
              space for a family-sized dining table. These details help clarify your true preferences and make it easier
              to find a home that meets both of your needs.
            </p>
            <b>
              How was the final score calculated?
            </b>
            <p>
              When you set priority levels for each feature, you're establishing the maximum score a home can achieve.
              Once you rate the characteristics of each house, those ratings are combined with the importance you’ve
              assigned to each one. The final score for each home is then calculated as a percentage of that maximum
              possible score. This helps you easily see how well each home aligns with your priorities.
            </p>
            <b>
              Share vs. Compare Mode
            </b>
            <p>
              Share mode lets you and your partner work together by entering information into the same form, creating a
              seamless and unified experience. This way, both of your inputs are captured in one place, making the
              decision-making process smoother and more collaborative.

              Compare mode allows each of you to enter your information separately and then compare your priorities and
              ratings side by side. It makes it easy to quickly see where you and your partner are on the same page and
              where your preferences differ, helping you focus on what matters most to both of you.
